# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis-using-NLP

**Project Overview**
This project focuses on analyzing the sentiment of tweets using Natural Language Processing (NLP). The goal is to classify tweets into positive, negative, or neutral categories based on their content. The project involves collecting Twitter data, preprocessing the text, applying NLP techniques, and training machine learning models to perform sentiment analysis.

**Prerequisites**
Before starting, ensure that you have the following installed:

Python 3.6 or later
A Python IDE or Jupyter Notebook
The following Python libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, nltk, re, and tweepy
**Setup Instructions**
Clone the Repository: Download the project files from the repository.

Install Required Libraries: Make sure all the necessary Python packages are installed. A requirements.txt file may be provided with the project to facilitate this.

Get Twitter API Keys: Create a Twitter Developer account and obtain your API keys. These keys are required to access Twitter data.

Run the Analysis: Follow the instructions in the project notebook or scripts to collect data, preprocess it, and perform sentiment analysis.

**Project Workflow**
Data Collection: Collect tweets related to specific keywords or hashtags using the Twitter API.

Data Preprocessing: Clean the collected tweets by removing irrelevant characters, links, and other noise. Tokenize the text and remove stopwords to prepare it for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize the data to understand its distribution and identify patterns or trends.

Feature Extraction: Convert the preprocessed text data into numerical features using methods like Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) or Count Vectorization.

Model Training: Train machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), or others on the labeled data to classify sentiment.

Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the trained model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Prediction: Use the trained model to predict the sentiment of new, unseen tweets.

**Results**
The project will output a model that can classify the sentiment of tweets as positive, negative, or neutral. You can visualize the results and explore how well the model performs on different datasets.
